# HexOcean food from!

node-version: 16.14.0
npm-version: 8.3.1

This application was created by CRA, You can start the application by running "npm run start".
It took me overall 6.5h to build this application which include around 2h to fix some mistakes i've made along the way.
I have decided to split the appliaction into eight components to keep the codebase clear and easy to understand.
